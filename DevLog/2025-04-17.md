# Development Log

* **Project Title**: Atelier

* **Date**: 2025-04-17

* **Current Task/Goal**: 
  - Incorporate AWS JavaScript CDK into Atelier.
  - Convert network and database templates into CDK stacks.
  - Test their deployment.

* **Progress/Updates**:
  - Successfully incorporated AWS CDK into the project.
  - Converted the network and database CloudFormation templates into CDK stacks.
  - Tested the deployment of the stacks, and all deployments were successful.

* **Challenges Encountered**:
  - Not many challenges were encountered. The AWS CDK documentation was comprehensive and easy to follow.

* **Decisions Made**:
  - Initially planned to build the infrastructure and the Express API incrementally while creating GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD. However, this approach was deemed shortsighted as it could lead to integration issues later.
  - Changed direction to focus on building the entire infrastructure first, ensuring all integrations work properly. Afterward:
    1. Create CI/CD pipelines.
    2. Begin development on the actual application.
  - This decision aligns with the project's primary focus on infrastructure capabilities rather than the application itself.

* **Solutions/Workarounds**:
  - Adjusted the project workflow to prioritize infrastructure development and integration testing before moving on to CI/CD and application development.

* **Next Steps**:
  - Complete the remaining infrastructure components.
  - Test integrations between all infrastructure components.
  - Begin creating CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

* **Reflections/Learnings**:
  - A solid plan and clear priorities are essential for avoiding integration issues and ensuring smooth development.
  - The AWS CDK is a powerful tool that simplifies infrastructure management and reduces complexity.
  - Focusing on the core goals of the project (infrastructure capabilities) helps maintain clarity and direction.
