# Development Log

* **Project Title**: Atelier

* **Date**: 2025-04-18

* **Current Task/Goal**: 
  - Build the backend Auto Scaling Group (ASG).
  - Create shared resource stacks for ALB and ASG to be used by both the frontend and backend stacks.
  - Plan and implement the shared Application Load Balancer (ALB).

* **Progress/Updates**:
  - Realized that security groups for EC2 instances were missing in the network stack. Edited the network stack to include the necessary security groups and their connections.
  - Deployed the updated network stack to AWS and verified that everything was working as expected.
  - Planned out the components required for the shared resource ALB, including:
    - Listener for HTTP requests.
    - Target group for routing traffic.
    - Networking resources.
    - Health checks for monitoring instance health.
  - Created the shared resource ALB stack and decided not to attach TLS certificates to the ALBs. CloudFront will handle TLS for the application.
  - Trusted AWS's internal network for secure communication between components.
  - Completed the shared resource ALB stack.

* **Challenges Encountered**:
  - Initially overlooked the need for EC2 security groups, which required revisiting and editing the network stack.
  - Balancing shared resources between the frontend and backend stacks required careful planning to avoid duplication and ensure reusability.

* **Decisions Made**:
  - Created shared resource stacks for ALB and ASG to avoid duplication and allow both frontend and backend stacks to use common resources.
  - Decided to rely on CloudFront for TLS termination instead of attaching certificates to the ALBs.
  - Trusted AWS's internal network for secure communication between components, simplifying the architecture.

* **Solutions/Workarounds**:
  - Edited the network stack to include the missing security groups and their connections.
  - Planned and implemented shared resource stacks to streamline resource management and ensure consistency across the frontend and backend.

* **Next Steps**:
  - Fully list out the components required for the shared resource ASG.
  - Begin implementing the shared resource ASG stack.
  - Test the integration of the shared ALB and ASG stacks with the network stack.

* **Reflections/Learnings**:
  - Revisiting and refining earlier decisions is sometimes necessary to ensure the architecture is complete and functional.
  - Shared resource stacks are a powerful way to reduce duplication and improve maintainability in complex architectures.
  - Trusting AWS's internal network for secure communication can simplify the architecture while maintaining security.
